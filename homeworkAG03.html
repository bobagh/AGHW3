```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#### Due: 2/17/2022 before 11:59pm. Submit in Canvas (file upload).

1. Finish the in-class practice in Slides 3-12 in "Lecture 2-2-Practice for git", link: https://yumouqiu.github.io/DS202-Spring2023/Practice/practice01.html  
    a. Download the RMarkdown file with these homework instructions to use as a template for your work. Make sure to replace "Your Name" with your name.  
    b. In the RMarkdown file, write down table of team members, and their github repository links;   
the number of successful pull requests you made, and the github repository to which you requested a change;  
the number of pull requests you accepted, and the github repository from which you accepted.  
    c. Write down a list with at least 3 tips of how to make working with git/github easier 
    
| member | repo                          | # of PRs made                         | # of Prs accepted |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Dhruv  | dsdole/practice1-your-gitname | **1** @ dsdole/AGHW3                  | **1**             |
| Ahmed  | bobagh/AGHW3                  | **1** @ bobagh/practice1-your-gitname | **1**             |

2. Generate the graph of LifExp vs. gdpPercap for US, Canada (fixed data) and Australia by RMarkdown based on the data set "gapminder-5060", like what we did in the class.  
Please use Github to collaborate on this problem. For example, one member can create the plot of US in his/her repository. The other member will fork this repository, add the result for the second country, and make a pull request for merging into the main repository. Each member should at least analyze one country and make at least one pull request. **Please submit the RMarkdown file, the output file, and the screen shot of the successful pull request and the merge.**
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
Ahmed:
```{r include=FALSE}
life5060 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yumouqiu/DS202-Spring2023/main/Lecture1_collaborative-environment/data/gapminder-5060.csv")
head(life5060)
dim(life5060)
```
```{r include=FALSE}
Australia <- life5060 %>% filter(country == "Australia")
head(Australia)
dim(Australia)
```
```{r include=FALSE}
log(exp(abs(-3)))
-3 %>% abs() %>% exp() %>% log()
```
```{r include=FALSE}
Australia1 <- life5060[life5060$country == "Australia", ]
head(Australia1)
dim(Australia1)
```
```{r}
Australia %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line()
```
Dhruv: 
```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsdole/practice1-your-gitname/300ee57bd22a06f2726855df4098032666f3fdb7/gapminder-5060.csv")
US <- data %>% filter(country == "United States")
ggplot(data = US, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_line()
```
3. Write a paragraph (~200 words) describing an example of what you consider data science. Write your paragraph in R Markdown. Include at least 

a. one link to a chart or an image:
Data science is a field that involves using various methods and techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. An example of data science is the analysis of customer behavior and preferences by a retail company to optimize its product offerings and marketing strategies. In this example, the company collects data on customer purchases, browsing history, and feedback to create a comprehensive database. The data is then cleaned, processed, and analyzed using statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and visualization tools to uncover patterns and trends. Based on the analysis, the company can identify which products are popular among customers and which marketing channels are most effective in reaching them. They can use this information to make data-driven decisions, such as optimizing the product mix, tailoring promotions to specific customer segments, and enhancing the customer experience. Through continuous analysis and experimentation, the company can improve its understanding of customer behavior and refine its strategies to increase sales and profitability. This example illustrates how data science can help companies make sense of complex and diverse data sets and derive actionable insights that drive business value.

b. at least one itemized or enumerated list.
1. Collect, process, and analyze data to uncover patterns and trends.
2. Use data-driven decision making to drive business value.
3. Involve various methods and techniques.
4. Aim to gain insights and inform decision making.
    

Note: your submission is supposed to be fully reproducible, i.e. the TA and I will 'knit' your submission in RStudio. Including the link to the image is the tricky part here. Make sure that you don't use any file structure that depends on your computing environment.


For the submission: submit your solution in an **R Markdown file** and (just for insurance) submit the corresponding html (or Word) file with it.
